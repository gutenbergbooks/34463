and to afford the reader a working knowledge
of the various classes of securities which are
available as investments and their relative
adaptability to different needs. The book is an
outgrowth of the writer's personal experience
as an investment banker. Most of the matter
which is presented has appeared in the pages of
"System" Magazine, through the courtesy of
whose editors it is now rearranged and consolidated

<h2>I</h2>

<h3>GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INVESTMENT</h3>


<p>With the immense increase in wealth in
the United States during the last decade
and its more general distribution, the problem
of investment has assumed correspondingly
greater importance. As long as the average
business man was an habitual borrower of
money and possest no private fortune outside
of his interest in his business, he was not
greatly concerned with investment problems.
The surplus wealth of the country for a long
time was in the hands of financial institutions
and a few wealthy capitalists. These men, the
officers and directors of banks, savings-banks,
and insurance companies, and the possessors of
hereditary wealth, were thoroughly equipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
by training and experience for the solving
of investment problems and needed no help in
the disposition of the funds under their control.
During the last ten years, however, these
conditions have been greatly altered. The
number of business men to-day in possession
of funds in excess of their private wants and
business requirements is far greater than it
was ten years ago, and is constantly increasing.
These men are confronted with a real
investment problem.</p>

<p>While they have not always recognized it,
the problem which they are called upon to
solve is really twofold&mdash;it concerns the safeguarding
of their private fortune and the wise
disposition of their business surplus. They
have usually seen the first part of this problem,
but not all have succeeded in clearly understanding
the second. When the treatment
of a man's business surplus is spoken of as an
investment problem, it is meant, of course, not
his working capital, which should be kept in
liquid form for immediate needs, but that
portion of his surplus which is set aside for
emergencies. It is coming to be a recognized
principle that every business enterprise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
whatever kind or size should establish a reserve
fund. It is felt that the possession of a reserve
fund puts the business upon a secure foundation,
adds to its financial strength and reputation,
and greatly increases its credit and borrowing
capacity. The recognition of this fact,
combined with the ability to set aside a reserve
fund, has brought many men to a consideration
of the best way in which to dispose of it.
It is obviously a waste of income to have the
surplus in bank-accounts; more than that, there
would be a constant temptation to use it and
to confuse it with working capital. Its best
disposition is plainly in some safe interest-bearing
security, which can be readily sold, so that
it will be available for use if necessity demands.</p>

<p>Confronted with the double problem thus
outlined, what measure of success has attended
the average business man in its solution?</p>

<p>It is safe to say that the average man has
found it easier to make money than to take
care of it. Money-making, for him, is the result
of successful activity in his own line of
business, with which he is thoroughly familiar;
while the investment of money is a thing apart
from his business, with which he is not familiar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and of which he may have had little practical
experience. His failure to invest money
wisely is not due to any want of intelligence
or of proper care and foresight on his part,
as he sometimes seems to believe, but simply
because he is ignorant of the principles of a
business which differs radically from his own.</p>

<p>The investment of money is a banker's business.
When the average man has funds to
invest, whether he be a business man or a pure
investor, he should consult some experienced
and reliable investment banker just as he would
consult a doctor or a lawyer if he were in need
of medical or legal advice. This book is not
intended to take the place of consultation with
a banker, but to supplement it.</p>

<p>The advantage of such consultation is shown
by the fact that if a man attempts to rely on
his own judgment, he is almost certain not to
do the best thing, even if his business instinct
leads him to avoid those enterprises which are
more plainly unpromising or fraudulent. It
should be remembered, however, that widows
and orphans are not the only ones ensnared
by attractive advertisements and the promise of
brilliant returns. In most cases, widows' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
orphans' funds are protected by conscientious
and conservative trustees, and it is the average
business man who furnishes the money which
is ultimately lost in all propositions which violate
the fundamental laws of investment.</p>

<p>The average man is led into these unwise
investments through a very natural error of
judgment. Accustomed to take reasonable
chances and to make large returns in his own
business, he fails to detect anything fundamentally
wrong in a proposition simply because it
promises to pay well. He forgets that the rate
of interest on <i>invested money</i>, or pure interest,
is very small, and that anything above that can
only come as payment for management, as he
makes in his own business, or at the sacrifice
of some essential factor of safety which will
usually lead to disaster.</p>

<p>For the successful investment of money,
however, a good deal more is required than
the mere ability to select a safe security. That
is only one phase of the problem. Scientific investment
demands a clear understanding of
the fundamental distinctions between different
classes of securities and strict adherence to the
two cardinal principles, distribution of risk and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
selection of securities in accordance with real
requirements.</p>

<p>One of the most important distinctions is
that between <i>promises to pay</i> and <i>equities</i>.
Bonds, real-estate mortgages, and loans on collateral
represent somebody's promise to pay a
certain sum of money at a future date; and if
the promise be good and the security ample,
the holder of the promise will be paid the money
at the time due. On the other hand, <i>equities</i>,
such as the capital stocks of banking, railway,
and industrial corporations, represent only a
certain residuary share in the assets and profits
of a working concern, after payment of its
obligations and fixt charges. The value of this
residuary share may be large or small, may
increase or diminish, but in no case can the
holder of such a share require any one, least
of all the company itself, to redeem the certificate
representing his interest at the price he
paid for it, nor indeed at any price. If a man
buys a $1,000 railroad bond, he knows that the
railroad, if solvent, will pay him $1,000 in cash
when the bond is due. But if he buys a share
of railroad stock, his only chance of getting his
money back, if he should wish it, is that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
one else will want to buy his share for what he
paid for it, or more. In one case he has bought
a <i>promise to pay</i>, and in the other an <i>equity</i>.</p>

<p>It is not the intention, from the foregoing,
to draw the conclusion that <i>equities</i> under no
circumstances are to be regarded as investments,
because many of our bank and railroad
stocks, and even some of our public-utility and
industrial stocks, have attained a stability and
permanence of value and possess sufficiently
long dividend records to justify their consideration
when investments are contemplated; but it
is essential that the investor should have a
thorough understanding of the distinction
involved.</p>

<p>The principle of distribution of risk is a simple
one. It involves no more than obedience
to the old rule which forbids putting all one's
eggs in the same basket. The number of men
who carry out this principle with any thoroughness,
however, is very small. Proper distribution
means not only the division of property
among the various forms of investment, as
railroad bonds, municipals, mortgages, public-utility
bonds, etc., but also the preservation of
proper geographical proportions within each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
form. Adherence to this principle is perhaps
not so important for private investors as for
institutions. A striking instance of the need
for insistence upon its observance in the institutional
field was furnished by one of the fire-insurance
companies of San Francisco after
the earthquake. It appeared that the company's
assets were largely invested in San Francisco
real estate and in local enterprises generally,
where the bulk of its fire risks were concentrated.
As a result, the very catastrophe which
converted its risks into actual liabilities deprived
its assets of all immediate value. This
instance serves to show the importance of the
principle and the necessity for its observance.</p>

<p>The principle of selection in accordance with
real requirements is more complex. It involves
a thorough understanding of the chief points
which must be considered in the selection of
all investments. These are five in number: (1)
<i>Safety of principal and interest</i>, or the assurance
of receiving the principal and interest on
the dates due; (2) <i>rate of income</i>, or the net
return which is realized on the actual amount
of money invested; (3) <i>convertibility into cash</i>,
or the readiness with which it is possible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
realize on the investment; (4) <i>prospect of appreciation
in value</i>, or that growth in intrinsic
value which tends to advance market price; and
(5) <i>stability of market price</i>, or the likelihood
of maintaining the integrity of the principal
invested.</p>

<p>The five qualities above enumerated are present
in different degrees in every investment,
and the scientific investor naturally selects
those securities which possess in a high degree
the qualities upon which he wishes to place
emphasis. A large part of the problem of investment
lies in the careful selection of securities
to meet one's actual requirements. The
average investor does not thoroughly understand
this point. He does not realize that a
high degree of one quality involves a lower
degree of other qualities. He may have a general
impression that a high rate of income is
apt to indicate less assurance of safety, but he
rarely applies the same reasoning to other qualities.
When he buys securities, he is quite
likely to pay for qualities which he does not
need. It is very common, for example, when
he wishes to make a permanent investment and
has no thought of reselling, to find him purchasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
securities which possess in a high degree
the quality of convertibility. From his
point of view, this is pure waste. A high degree
of convertibility is only obtained at the
sacrifice of some other quality&mdash;usually rate of
income. If he were to use more care in his
selections, he could probably find some other
security possessing equal safety, equal stability,
and equal promise of appreciation in value,
which would yield considerably greater revenue,
lacking only ready convertibility. Thus
he would satisfy his real requirements and obtain
a greater income, at the expense only of
a quality which he does not need.</p>

<p>The quality of convertibility divides investors
into classes more sharply than any other
quality. For some investors convertibility is a
matter of small importance; for others it is the
paramount consideration. Generally speaking,
the private investor does not need to place much
emphasis upon the quality of convertibility, at
least for the larger part of his estate. On the
other hand, for a business surplus, ready convertibility
is an absolute necessity, and in order
to secure it, something in the way of income
must usually be sacrificed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, some investors are so situated that
they can insist strongly upon promise of appreciation
in value, while others can not afford to
do so. Rich men whose income is in excess of
their wants, can afford to forego something in
the way of yearly return for the sake of a
strong prospect of appreciation in value. Such
men naturally buy bank and trust-company
stocks, whose general characteristic is a small
return upon the money invested, but a strong
likelihood of appreciation in value. This is owing
to the general practise of well-regulated
banks to distribute only about half their earnings
in dividends and to credit the rest to surplus,
thus insuring a steady rise in the book
value of the stock. Rich men, again, can afford to
take chances with the quality of safety, for the
sake of greater income, in a way which poor
men should never do. In practise, however, if
the writer's observation can be depended upon,
it is usually the poor men who take the chances&mdash;and
lose their money.</p>

<p>In the quality of safety, there is a marked
difference between safety of principal and
safety of interest. With some investments the
principal is much safer than the interest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<i>vice versa</i>. This can best be illustrated by examples.
The bonds of terminal companies,
which are guaranteed as to interest, under the
terms of a lease, by the railroads which use
the terminal, are usually far safer as to interest
than as to principal. While the lease lasts, the
interest is probably perfectly secure, but when
the lease expires and the bonds mature, the
railroads may see fit to abandon the terminal
and build one elsewhere, if the city has grown
in another direction, and the terminal may cease
to have any value except as real estate. On
the other hand, a new railroad, built in a
thinly settled but rapidly growing part of the
country, may have difficulty in bad years in
meeting its interest charges, and may even go
into temporary default, but if the bonds are
issued at a low rate per mile and the management
of the road is honest and capable, the
safety of the principal can scarcely be questioned.</p>

<p>Stability of market price is frequently a consideration
of great importance. This quality
should never be confused with the quality of
safety. Safety means the assurance that the
maker of the obligation will pay principal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
interest when due; stability of market price
means that the investment shall not shrink in
quoted value. These are very different things,
tho frequently identified in people's minds. An
investment may possess assured safety of principal
and interest and yet suffer a violent decline
in quoted price, owing to a change in
general business and financial conditions. In
times of continued business prosperity very
high rates are demanded for the use of money,
because the liquid capital of the country, to a
large extent, has been converted into fixt forms,
in the development of new mines, the building
of new factories and railroads, and in the improvement
and extension of existing properties.
These high rates have the effect of reducing
the price level of investment securities because
people having such securities are apt to sell
them in order to lend the money so released,
thus maintaining the parity between the yields
upon free and invested capital.</p>

<p>As an illustration of this tendency, within
the last few years New York City 3&frac12;-per-cent
bonds have declined from 110 to 90, without
the slightest suspicion of their safety. Their
inherent qualities have changed in no respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
except that their prospect of appreciation in
quoted price has become decidedly brighter.
Their fall in price has been due to two factors,
one general and the other special&mdash;first, the
absorption of liquid capital and consequent rise
in interest rates, occasioned by the unprecedented
business activity of the country, and,
second, to the unfavorable technical position of
the bonds, due to an increased supply in the
face of a decreased demand.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the question of maintaining
the integrity of the money invested is
a matter of great importance and deserves to
rank as a fifth factor in determining the selection
of investments, altho it is not an inherent
quality of each investment, but is dependent
for its effect upon general conditions.
If it is essential to the investor that his security
should not shrink in quoted price, his best investment
is a real-estate mortgage, which is
not quoted and consequently does not fluctate.
For the investment of a business surplus, however,
where a high degree of convertibility is
required, real-estate mortgages will not answer,
and the best way to guard against shrinkage
is to purchase a short-term security, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
approach to maturity will maintain the price
close to par.</p>

<p>The foregoing comments, in a brief and imperfect
way, serve to indicate the main points
which should be considered in the selection of
securities for investment. The considerations
advanced will be amplified as occasion demands
in the following pages. For the present, the
main lesson which it is sought to draw is the
necessity that a man should have a thorough
understanding of his real requirements before
he attempts to make investments. For a private
investor to go to a banker and ask him to
suggest a security to him without telling him
the exact nature of his wants is about as foolish
as it would be for a patient to go to a physician
and ask him to give him some medicine without
telling him the symptoms of the trouble
which he wished cured. In neither case can
the adviser act intelligently unless he knows
what end he is seeking to accomplish.</p>

<p>It is plainly impossible within the limits of
a small volume to consider the needs of all
classes of investors. Special attention will be
paid to the requirements of a business surplus
and of the private investor. In the field of private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
investment two distinct classes can be recognized&mdash;those
who are dependent upon income
from investments and those who are not.
Both classes will be considered. For the investment
of a business surplus, safety, convertibility,
and stability of price are the qualities
to be <a name="emphasized" id="emphasized"></a>emphasized; for investors dependent upon
income, safety and a high return; and for those
not dependent upon income, a high return and
prospect of appreciation in value. In the following
chapters railroad bonds, real-estate
mortgages, industrial, public-utility, and municipal
bonds and stocks will be considered in
turn; their advantages and disadvantages will
be analyzed in accordance with the determining
qualities above enumerated, and their adaptability
to the requirements of a business surplus
and of private investment will be discust.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<h3>RAILROAD MORTGAGE BONDS</h3>


<p>A railroad bond is an obligation of a
railroad company (usually secured by
mortgage upon railroad property) which runs
for a certain length of time at a certain rate
of interest. It is apparent, from this definition,
that the price of a railroad bond, as distinct
from its value, is affected by two <i>accidental
conditions</i> quite apart from the five determining
qualities described in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>These accidental conditions are the length of
time that the bond has to run and the rate of
interest that it bears. To understand clearly
the influence of these accidental conditions is a
matter of the utmost importance. It is evident,
for instance, that a 5-per-cent fifty-year bond,
based on a given security, will sell at a widely
different price from a 3&frac12;-per-cent twenty-year
bond, based on the same security; yet the only
difference is in the accidental conditions which
are under the control of the board of directors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to eliminate these accidental features
from the situation, it is customary for
bond-dealers to classify bonds purely on the
basis of their yield, or net income return. As
a thorough understanding of this point is essential
to an accurate judgment of bond values,
whether railroad bonds or otherwise, it must
be developed in detail, even at the risk of carrying
the reader over familiar ground.</p>

<p>If a bond sells above par, it does not yield
its purchaser a net return as great as the rate
of interest which the bond bears, for two reasons:
first, because the loss in principal, represented
by the premium which the purchaser
pays, must be distributed over the number of
years which the bond has to run, and operates
to reduce the rate of interest which the holder
receives; and, secondly, because the rate is paid
only on the par value of the bond instead of
on the actual money invested. Thus, if a 6-percent
bond with eight years to run sells at 110&frac34;,
it will yield only 4.40 per cent, which means
that if the holder spends more than $48.73
(4.40 per cent of $1,107.50) out of the $60
which he receives annually, he is spending the
excess out of principal, and not out of income.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Conversely, if a bond sells below par, it yields
more than the rate of interest which the bond
bears.</p>

<p>These yields have been calculated with the
utmost exactness for all bonds paying from 2
per cent to 7 per cent and running from six
months to one hundred years, so that it is only
necessary to turn to the tables to discover what
will be the net return upon a given bond at a
given price. This net return is generally
known as the "basis," and bonds are spoken of
as selling upon a 3.80 per cent basis or a 4.65
per cent basis or whatever the figure may be,
with no reference whatever to the price or to
the rate of interest which the bond bears. Indeed,
so exclusively is the basis considered by
bond-dealers that very often bonds are bought
and sold upon a basis price, and the actual
figures at which the bonds change hands are
not determined until after the transaction is
concluded.</p>

<p>It is not expected, of course, that the average
business man will purchase bonds in quite as
scientific a way as this, but it is essential that
he should understand that while the intrinsic
value of a bond is determined only by the five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
general factors described, its money value, or
price, is affected also by these two accidental
conditions. Exprest in other words, he must
realize that the general factor described as
<i>rate of income</i> does not mean the coupon rate
of interest which the bond bears, but the scientific
"basis," derived by elimination of the accidental
features.</p>

<p>Within the past year there has been a
good deal of uninformed comment about the
safety of railroad bonds. Before the era of
popular agitation and governmental antagonism,
railroad bonds enjoyed a large measure of
public confidence; but it can not be denied that
some part of this confidence has been shaken
as a result of the recent exposures. Even clearheaded
men have exaggerated the importance
of the developments; and too often railroad officials,
who should have insisted upon the soundness
and stability of their properties, when
they elected to talk for publication, have given
way instead to dismal and unwarranted forebodings.</p>

<p>There is no mystery involved in determining
the safety of railroad bonds. Any man of business
experience, keeping in mind the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
principle which measures the value of all obligations,
can easily determine, with the aid of
two documents, the degree of safety which attaches
to any particular railroad bond. The
general principle to be observed is that the
safety of any obligation depends upon the margin
of security in excess of the amount of the
loan; and the two documents to be consulted
are the mortgage or trust indenture securing
the bonds, which describes the property mortgaged,
and the last annual report of the railroad,
which shows its financial condition.</p>

<p>Confining the analysis, for the present, to
mortgage bonds upon the general mileage of
a railroad, the following points should be considered:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Rate per mile at which the bond is
issued.</i> Applying the general principle indicated
above, it must be learned what proportion
the bonded debt of a railroad bears to the
total market value of the property. It is much
easier to make this comparison on a per-mile
basis. In determining whether the rate per
mile is excessive, reference must be made not
so much to the particular bond in question as
to the total bonded debt per mile of the railroad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and to the relation which that figure bears
to the total market value of the property per
mile. The total market value per mile is obtained
by adding the market value of the stock
per mile to the par value of the bonded debt
per mile. A single issue of bonds varies all the
way from $5,000 to $100,000 per mile, according
to the location of the railroad. Total capitalization
per mile&mdash;stocks and bonds at par&mdash;varies
in about the same proportion, from $35,000
to $300,000. The average for all the railroads
of the United States is $67,936 per mile.
The actual cost of the railroad, as shown by the
balance-sheet, must be taken into consideration,
and also the estimated cost of duplicating the
property. Physical difficulties of construction
must be weighed, for a railroad through a flat,
sandy country should not be bonded for as
much, other things being equal, as a railroad
through a mountainous country, where much
cutting, filling, and bridging are required. The
section of country in which the railroad is
located must be considered, for $35,000 per
mile on a single-track line in a poor country
may be higher than $300,000 per mile on a
four-track trunk line which owns valuable terminals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and rights of way through several large
cities.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Amount of prior lien bonds outstanding
per mile.</i> The amount of bonds which come
ahead of the bond in question on the same
mileage is a matter of great importance and
works directly against the security of the bond.
Purchasing a bond which is preceded by a
prior line bond is like taking a real-estate mortgage
on property already encumbered. If the
bond is not followed by other bonds, then the
margin of security in the property is represented
wholly by the market value of the stock
per mile, and the investor must figure carefully
the value of this equity.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Amount of junior lien bonds outstanding
per mile.</i> The amount of bonds which come
after the bond in question, on the other hand,
works directly in favor of the bond, for it increases
the margin of security. It shows also
that other people have had sufficient confidence
in the property to invest their money in obligations
subject to the one in question. In the
event of a receivership this is often a matter of
great importance; for if a foreclosure sale is
ordered the junior bondholders, in order to protect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
their own interest, must buy in the property
for an amount at least equal to the par value of
the prior lien bonds.</p>

<p>The foregoing considerations apply particularly
to the safety of the principal invested in
railroad bonds; the following points affect the
safety of interest:</p>

<p>(4) <i>Gross earnings per mile.</i> The gross
earnings of a railroad must be compared with
those of other roads occupying the same field,
and the returns for a number of years must be
examined to determine whether such earnings
have increased or decreased. The position in
which the railroad stands for obtaining new
traffic must be noted. This is dependent somewhat
upon the railroad's ability to take traffic
from other railroads, but more upon the probable
growth and development of the territory
which the railroad serves, and the increased
traffic which will probably be offered. In this
connection the rate of increase in population in
the road's territory is important. The proportion
between passenger and freight earnings,
the diversity and density of freight traffic, and
passenger and freight rates should be examined.
The reputation of the management<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for ability and integrity should be considered.
Gross earnings run from about $3,000 to $40,000
per mile with the average $10,460.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Net income per mile.</i> Net income is
obtained by subtracting from gross earnings
operating expenses (and sometimes taxes) and
adding to the net earnings so obtained whatever
income from other sources the railroad
may derive. This is a very important figure.
As with gross earnings, the reports should be
examined to determine whether net income is
on the increase or the decrease, and it should
be compared with the net income of other railroads
occupying the same field. It involves a
criticism of operating expenses. The payments
of the railroad must be analyzed to determine
whether the proper sums have been expended
for maintenance of way, replenishment of rolling
stock, and other improvements sufficient to
keep the road in good physical condition. Normally
speaking, operating expenses should absorb
about 65 per cent of gross earnings. If it is
found that a railroad operates for 60 per cent,
however, it does not always follow that its operating
officials are exceptionally efficient, so that
the cost of conducting transportation is relatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
small; it may mean that the physical condition
of the property is being neglected, or that
ordinary improvements, which should be
charged to maintenance, are being paid for by
increase in capitalization. It is very important
for the investor to find out which is the case. If
analysis leads to the suspicion that the earnings
result from neglecting the property or capitalizing
every trivial improvement, the railroad's
bonds should be rejected. Net income varies
from $1,500 to $12,000 per mile, with an average
of $4,702.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Fixt charges per mile.</i> The fixt charges
of a railroad include interest on its bonds, rentals,
and taxes (when the last-named are not
reported with operating expenses). The importance
of this figure lies in its relation to net
income. If a railroad does not earn well over
double its fixt charges, its obligations can not be
regarded as in the first investment rank. Of
course, when a railroad earns more than twice
the interest requirement upon its entire bonded
debt, it is probable that some of the underlying
bonds are protected by three, four, or five times
the interest requirement upon them, and their
position is correspondingly strengthened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing analysis applies particularly
to mortgage bonds upon the general mileage of
a railroad and not to such special issues as collateral
trust, terminal, bridge, or guaranteed
bonds. It will not be necessary, however, to
lay down any rules as to these classes of bonds,
for the general principles outlined above, with
slight modifications of detail, will be found
equally applicable to a judgment of their value.
Equipment bonds, on the other hand, owing to
their want of similarity to any other railroad
issues, will receive separate treatment later.</p>

<p>It is of interest, in view of the present diminished
confidence in railroad securities, to advance
certain considerations touching upon the
safety of railroad bonds in general.</p>

<p>The last published report of the Inter-State
Commerce Commission, year 1906, furnishes
interesting testimony on this subject. A table
on page 60 shows that the total railroad capital
of the United States for that year was $14,570,421,478,
of which $7,766,661,385, or 53.31 per
cent, was in the form of bonded debt, and the
rest in capital stock.</p>

<p>These figures indicate a substantial equity,
but are somewhat misleading because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
refer to par value. A fair estimate of the market
value of this stock equity, which is the margin
of security in the properties from the
bondholder's point of view, can be obtained
from a table on page 82, which shows a balance
available for dividends, after paying all operating
expenses and fixt charges, of all the railroads
of the United States for the year ended
June 30, 1906, of $457,060,326. This amount
is equivalent to nearly 7 per cent upon the total
par value of the stocks.</p>

<p>Estimating that a railroad stock should earn
10 per cent upon its market price&mdash;and even
the most prejudiced will admit that a stock
earning 10 per cent is worth par&mdash;the total
market value of American railroad stocks
would be $4,570,603,260, or more than half the
par value of the bonds. In other words, the
bonded debt would represent something less
than 63 per cent of the total market value of
the property. This compares favorably with
the security of first mortgages upon real estate.</p>

<p>When the safety of interest is considered,
the showing made is equally strong. Page
82 of the report above quoted shows that
the net income of the railroads of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
States for the year ended June 30, 1906, after
payment of all operating expenses, was $848,836,771,
and the total fixt charges, including
interest on bonds, interest on current liabilities,
and taxes, amounted to $391,776,445, leaving a
balance available for dividends of $457,060,326.
It is apparent, therefore, that the net
earnings of the railroads of the United States,
considered as one system, could be cut in half
without affecting the payment of interest upon
the railroad's obligations. This affords a large
measure of protection.</p>

<p>The following analysis shows that the actual
market value of the railroads is probably
greater than the estimate made above.</p>

<blockquote><p>The table shows the percentage of bonded debt to
total market value of some of the more important
railroad systems. Two trunk lines in the East, a
north and south line in the middle West, and two
transcontinental have been chosen. No attempt
has been made to select railroads which would make
a favorable showing. Indeed Pennsylvania, and
Union Pacific, by reason of their recent heavy bond
issues, probably compare unfavorably with others
which might have been chosen. The figures showing
the par value of bonds outstanding have been
taken from last annual reports, with additions made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>for recent issues. The figures showing the market
value of stocks are based on the amounts outstanding
April 1st, 1908, at the market price.</p></blockquote>

<p>In view of the enormous decline which has
occurred in railroad stocks during the past
eighteen months, the showing above is truly remarkable.
It is plain that the entire bonded
debt of any of these standard railroads is less
than 60 per cent of the total market value of the
property, while in the cases of the Pennsylvania,
Great Northern, and Union Pacific, <i>more than
half of the present market value of the property
could be erased before the lien of the bonds least
well secured would be impaired</i>.</p>

<p>Of course, where the entire bonded debt is
protected by such a margin, it is evident that
the underlying bonds (the prior liens and first
mortgages) are protected by several times as
great a margin and their position is correspondingly
strengthened.</p>

<p>The foregoing analysis, in the judgment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the writer, affords convincing proof not only
that the prevailing want of confidence in railroad
obligations is without foundation, but that
railroad bonds compare favorably in point of
safety with any other form of investment.</p>

<p>It remains to point out the amount of income
and degree of convertibility which they afford
and the extent of appreciation in value which
they promise. It is impossible to do more than
indicate the general characteristics of railroad
bonds in these particulars.</p>

<p>Railroad bonds cover a wide range of income
return. They yield all the way from 3&frac34; per
cent to 9 per cent, the general average being
from 4 per cent to 6 per cent. As a class they
yield more than government or municipal
bonds, and less than public-utility or industrial
bonds. With equal security they probably yield
less than real-estate mortgages. Compared
with stocks they return more than bank stocks,
average about the same as railroad stocks, and
yield less than public-utility, industrial, or mining
stocks. These comparisons are intended to
apply to the classes as a whole, and remain generally
true in spite of specific cases to the contrary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Convertibility is the distinguishing mark of
railroad bonds. Generally speaking they may
be more easily marketed than any other class of
bonds. Compared with stocks they exceed public-utility,
mining, and bank stocks in point of
convertibility, and yield only to railroad stocks.
It is hard to say whether or not they possess
greater convertibility than industrial stocks,
but it is probable that they do, allowing for the
fact that an undue impression is created by the
activity of certain prominent shares.</p>

<p>Railroad bonds as a class possess great
promise of appreciation in value. American
railroads, generally speaking, have adopted the
conservative policy of putting a considerable
part of their annual earnings back into the
property in the form of improvements. To the
extent to which this policy is followed, an equity
is created back of the bonds which raises their
intrinsic value. This policy contrasts favorably
with the general practise of English roads
to pay out all their earnings in dividends, and
to capitalize their improvements. In addition,
new capital for American railroads is largely
raised by stock issues, which further increases
the margin of security for the bondholders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Taken together these facts insure a steady enhancement
in the intrinsic value of railroad
bonds, which is bound to be reflected, other
things being equal, in higher prices.</p>

<p>We shall not attempt to discuss at this time
the degree of stability of market price which
railroad bonds enjoy. As explained in the first
chapter, stability of market price is dependent
upon general financial and business conditions.
It is sufficient to point out here that the maintenance
intact of the principal sum invested can
only be rendered certain by the purchase of
short-time securities whose near approach to
maturity will keep their price close to par. In
a later chapter the general principles which determine
this question will be elucidated.</p>

<p>The ideal investment may be defined as one
combining ample security of principal and interest,
a good rate of income, ready convertibility
into cash, and reasonable promise of
appreciation in value. Measured by the requirements
of this definition, the conclusion
seems justified that well-selected railroad
bonds, if purchased under favorable money-market
conditions, afford a highly desirable
form of investment.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<h3>RAILROAD EQUIPMENT BONDS</h3>

<p>As its name implies, an equipment bond is
one issued by a railroad to provide funds
with which to pay for new rolling stock&mdash;cars
and locomotives. The issues are variously described
as car trust certificates, equipment
bonds, or equipment notes. They conform in
general to one of two standard forms: (1) The
conditional sale plan: In accordance with specifications
furnished by the railroad, the trustee
selected (usually a trust company) contracts
with the builders for the purchase of the equipment.
From 10 to 20 per cent of the cost of
the equipment is paid in cash by the railroad
and the rest is represented by the equipment
bonds. The bonds are the direct obligation of
the railroad company. They are secured by a
first lien upon the entire equipment purchased.
The title to the equipment remains in the trustee
for the benefit of the bondholders until the
last bond has been paid, so that under no circumstances
can the general mortgages of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
railroad attach as a first lien on the equipment
ahead of the car trust obligations. After the
final payment, the trustee assigns title to the
railroad company, which thereupon becomes
the owner in fee of the equipment. Under the
terms of the deed of trust the railroad is always
obliged to keep the equipment fully insured, in
good order and complete repair, and to replace
any equipment which may become worn out,
lost, or destroyed. The bonds are usually
issued in coupon form, $1,000 each, bearing
semiannual interest, with provision for registration.
They are generally paid off in semiannual
or annual instalments of substantially
equal amounts, the last instalment usually
falling due in ten years, a period well within
the life of the equipment as estimated under
the master car builder's rules. Occasionally
this method of payment is altered by the substitution
of a sinking fund, the bonds having a
uniform fixt maturity, but subject to the operation
of a sinking fund which is sufficient to
retire the entire issue well within the life of the
equipment. In either case the security, ample
at the outset, increases proportionally with the
reduction in obligations outstanding against it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) The so-called "Philadelphia plan." Under
this plan the equipment is purchased by an
individual, association, or corporation which
leases the equipment to the railroad for a term
of years at a rental equivalent to the interest
and maturing instalments of the bonds. The
contract of lease is then assigned to a trust company
as trustee, which thereupon issues its certificates
in substantially the form described in
the plan above, these representing a beneficial
interest in the equipment, which are usually
guaranteed both principal and interest by the
railroad. The lease runs until the last bond
has been paid, after which the trustee assigns
title to the railroad as above. The chief advantage
of this plan over the other is that in some
States, notably Pennsylvania, certificates issued
in accordance with its terms are exempt from
taxation, whereas under the conditional sale
plan, as the direct obligation of the railroad,
the bonds would be taxable.</p>

<p>It is evident from the foregoing description
that equipment bonds differ in two important
respects from all other classes of railroad
issues. First, the title to the property which
secures the bonds does not vest in the railroad;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and, secondly, the property is movable and not
fixt in any one locality.</p>

<p>By virtue of these two points, the holders
of equipment bonds possess a great advantage
over the holders of mortgage bonds in the event
of a railroad's becoming bankrupt.</p>

<p>If a railroad is unable to meet its interest
charges, the mortgage bondholders can rarely
do better than have a receiver appointed
who will operate the railroad in their interest;
but if, with honest and efficient management,
the railroad can not be made to earn its interest
charges, the mortgage bondholders usually
have to consent to the scaling of their bonds
to a point where the railroad can operate upon
a paying basis.</p>

<p>With the holders of equipment bonds the
case is quite different. If the receiver defaults
upon their bonds they have only to direct the
trustee to enter upon possession of the equipment
and sell it or lease it to some other railroad.
The knowledge that they possess this
power renders its exercise generally unnecessary.
The equipment of a railroad is essential
to its operation. It is the tool with which the
railroad handles its business. If the receiver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
were deprived of the equipment it would be impossible
for him to operate the road, and so
he could never satisfy its creditors. Consequently
the courts, both State and Federal, have
ruled that the necessary equipment of a bankrupt
railroad must be preserved, and have
placed the charges for principal and interest of
equipment obligations upon an equality with
charges for wages, materials, and other operating
expenses, and in priority to interest of even
first-mortgage bonds.</p>

<p>These points sufficiently explain the remarkable
record which equipment bonds have made
during reorganizations. Careful investigation
has been made of the various railroads which
were reorganized, either with or without foreclosure,
between the years 1888 and 1905. This
covers the chief period of railroad receivership.
It was discovered that sixteen different railroads,
aggregating nearly one hundred thousand
miles and located in widely different parts
of the country, had outstanding equipment
bonds at the time of default. In every case the
principal and interest of equipment bonds were
paid in full, while all other securities, with a
few exceptions, were reduced in rate or amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
or both. Two of these railroads offered to the
holders of equipment bonds the option of an
advantageous exchange of securities, which
amounted to more than payment in full.</p>

<p>The foregoing facts justify the conclusion
that equipment bonds possess security equal or
superior to that of any other form of railroad
bonds.</p>

<p>Let us now consider their remaining characteristics&mdash;their
rate of income, convertibility,
prospect of appreciation in value, and stability
of market price.</p>

<p>One of the strongest features of equipment
bonds is the relatively high rate of income
which they yield. The amount realized varies
in accordance with the financial strength and
credit of the issuing railroad, and the margin
of security in the equipment itself. As a general
rule, the net return on the equipment bonds
of a given railroad is usually from &frac12; per cent
to &frac34; per cent greater than on the first-mortgage
bonds of the same railroad. This is
owing to the fact that while banks and scientific
investors have bought equipment bonds for
many years, the general public is not sufficiently
familiar with the inherent strength of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
these issues to create much of a demand for
them. This insures a good return.</p>

<p>Equipment bonds vary in point of convertibility.
The reader will remember from the
description above that equipment bonds are usually
issued in serial form, with instalments maturing
semiannually from six months to ten
years. By confining purchases to the shorter
maturities, say within two or three years, a high
degree of convertibility may usually be obtained
because the short maturities are greatly sought
by banks and other financial institutions which
regard equipment bonds in much the same light
as merchant's paper or time loans secured by collateral.
At a price equivalent to the rate which
the best commercial paper commands, there is
always a good demand from the banks. Many
banks prefer equipment bonds to loans or paper
on account of their greater convertibility. As
the length of maturity increases, the degree of
convertibility generally decreases, because the
chief demand for the longer dates comes from
insurance companies, which do not, in the aggregate,
constitute as great a demand as the
banks. When the demand from private investors
increases, as it undoubtedly will when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
become more familiar with the desirable points
of these issues, all maturities will probably possess
ready convertibility.</p>

<p>In the same way, equipment bonds vary as
to stability of market price. Compared with
other classes of railroad issues, equipment
bonds are all relatively stable, but the stability
is especially marked in the shorter maturities.</p>

<p>Equipment bonds possess little prospect of
appreciation in value.</p>

<p>The attentive reader who has carefully followed
the foregoing description of equipment
bonds, may have noticed a special adaptability
on their part to the requirements of a business
surplus. Broadly speaking, for such investment,
a security is required which will combine
perfect safety of principal and interest, a good
rate of income, ready convertibility into cash,
and unyielding stability of market price. The
necessity for insistence upon these requirements
in the investment of a business surplus will
appear upon a moment's reflection. Safety is
required in all forms of investment, but is particularly
important in the handling of business
funds; a good rate of income is always desirable;
convertibility is necessary for a business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
surplus so that the reserve funds may be converted
into cash at any time; and it is of the
utmost importance that the security should not
shrink materially in quoted price, no matter
what changes may take place in financial and
business conditions, so that if the need should
arise for realizing on the reserve fund, it would
be found unimpaired in amount. As explained
in a former chapter, this point can not be covered
by the selection of securities perfectly safe
as to principal and interest, but only by the purchase
of short-term obligations.</p>

<p>The point may be illustrated as follows: Let
it be supposed that a firm or company has decided
to invest $100,000 in the 5-per-cent equipment
bonds of a good railroad maturing in
three years, which can be obtained at par, merchant's
paper then commanding about 5&frac12; per
cent. After two years it becomes necessary for
the firm to realize on its investment at a time
when commercial paper is floated with difficulty
on a 6&frac12;-per-cent or 7-per-cent basis. Under
such money conditions the equipment bonds
could be sold on about a 6-per-cent basis, which
would mean a price of 99 for a 5-per-cent bond
with one year to run. The firm, in liquidating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
its investment, would therefore lose 1 per cent
in principal, but would have received 5 per cent
interest for two years, making the net return
4&frac12; per cent. Compare this showing with the
result if the bonds when originally bought had
had ten years to run instead of three.</p>

<p>After two years, when the firm wished to
dispose of its bonds it might experience some
difficulty in doing so in the stringent money
market which has been supposed, but even if
it succeeded in selling them upon a 6-per-cent
basis, that would mean a price of only 93&frac34; and
would represent 6&frac14;-per-cent loss in principal.
If it were necessary to sell the bonds upon a
higher basis or if the firm had purchased a bond
with more than ten years to run, the relative
disadvantage of the longer bond would be still
more apparent. These points sufficiently demonstrate
the importance of buying only short-term
securities for the investment of a business
surplus. Of course, if money conditions improve
instead of becoming worse between the
dates of purchase and sale, then a greater profit
would be made with the longer-term bond.
This, however, should not be allowed to influence
the choice, first because it is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
object of a reserve fund to make a speculative
profit, and secondly because a firm or corporation
is only likely to want to realize upon its
reserve fund when money is hard to obtain
otherwise, and that is precisely the time when
any long-term bond would be apt to show considerable
depreciation.</p>

<p>The foregoing considerations indicate a special
adaptability on the part of equipment bonds
to the usual requirements of a business surplus.
The points have been brought out at some
length because of the importance of the subject
to the average business man. The purpose in
concentrating attention upon a single instance
has been to illustrate more clearly the principles
involved and at the same time to acquaint
the business man with details of a highly
desirable and somewhat unfamiliar form of
security.</p>

<h3>REAL-ESTATE MORTGAGES</h3>


<p>In the preceding chapter the discussion of
railroad bonds was brought to a close. Before
passing to the consideration of real-estate
mortgages, which is the next form of investment
to be taken up, it may be well to review
briefly the general principles advanced in the
first chapter of this book, in order that the
reader may have clearly in mind the main
points upon which judgment of the value of investments
should be based.</p>

<p>There are five chief points to be considered
in the selection of all forms of investment.
These are: (1) safety of principal and interest;
(2) rate of income; (3) convertibility into
cash; (4) prospect of appreciation in intrinsic
value; (5) stability of market price.</p>

<p>Keeping these five general factors in mind,
the present chapter will discuss real-estate
mortgages as a form of investment, both as
adapted to the requirements of private funds
and of a business surplus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The average American business man is so
familiar with real-estate mortgages that the
details may be passed over briefly. A real-estate
mortgage, or a bond and mortgage, as
it is sometimes called, consists essentially of
two parts, a bond or promise to pay a certain
sum of money at a future date with interest at
a certain rate per annum, and a mortgage or
trust deed transferring title and ownership in
a piece of real estate, with the provision that
the transfer shall be void if the interest is regularly
paid and the bond redeemed at maturity.
Before advancing money on the security of a
mortgage it is necessary to determine whether
the title to the property legally vests in the
maker of the mortgage; and during the continuance
of the mortgage it is necessary to have
proof that the taxes and assessments are being
regularly paid, and, in the case of improved
property, the fire-insurance as well.</p>

<p>The safety of real-estate mortgages, in common
with the safety of all obligations, depends
upon the margin of security in excess of the
amount of the loan. In the case of real-estate
mortgages the amount of this margin may be
determined without great difficulty. It is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
necessary to have the property carefully appraised
by an expert in real-estate values. It
does not follow, however, because a mortgage
has been shown to possess substantial equity,
that it is perfectly safe as an investment, unless it
satisfies also another condition of great importance.
A mortgage may not exceed 50 per cent
of the selling value of the real estate pledged,
and yet be a poor investment. This point involves
a serious objection to real-estate mortgages
which sometimes escapes notice.</p>

<p>The holder of a mortgage is at a great disadvantage
in regard to the changing value of
real estate. If the value of the property upon
which he holds a mortgage increases, the additional
value enhances the security of the loan,
but does not add to the principal which he has
invested, while if the value of the property diminishes,
not only is the security proportionately
lessened, but if the impairment be great,
the holder is frequently compelled to take over
the property and may suffer loss of principal.
In other words, he receives no direct benefit
from an increase in the value of the property,
but has to stand the larger part of the risk of
a decline in its value.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>This is not the case with investments represented
by negotiable securities subject to changing
market quotations. All such securities,
railroad bonds for example, are acted on
equally by changes in the value of the property
which secures them. Except for the influences
of money-market conditions, railroad bonds advance
with an increase in the value of the property
and decline with a decrease in its value.
Well-selected bonds usually increase in value
with time, and all such increase goes directly
to the benefit of the holder. The failure of real-estate
mortgages to respond similarly to
changes in the value of property places the
holder of a mortgage at a great disadvantage.</p>

<p>Owing to this characteristic, real-estate
mortgages should be purchased only when general
conditions in the real-estate market are
distinctly favorable. Not only should the purchaser
of a mortgage have sufficient margin of
security in the particular piece of property upon
which he is loaning money, but he should also
be satisfied that general real-estate values are
relatively low, that there has been no undue
speculation, and that conditions favor an advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
rather than a decline in real-estate
prices.</p>

<p>No class of property is subject to more rapid
changes in value than real estate. After an
extensive advance the holder of a mortgage
may be insufficiently protected by the equity in
the property, even if his mortgage represents
only 60 per cent of the current appraised value
of the real estate pledged. It may be that the
60 per cent which he has loaned represents the
total value or more than the total value a few
years before. When a rapid advance in values
occurs, tho it may be largely justified by the
growth and development of the territory, there
is sure to be present an element of speculation
which is likely to carry prices beyond the point
of reason. When the turn comes and a severe
collapse takes place, its effects are extremely
disastrous, because, unlike speculation in stocks
or commodities, no short selling exists in real
estate to temper the fall, and the immobile form
of capital makes liquidation impossible. These
considerations serve to show the need for great
prudence in the purchase of real-estate mortgages.
If the investor exercises due care in
these particulars, he is reasonably sure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
obtaining a very high-grade security; if he
neglects these precautions, he may suffer severe
loss of principal.</p>

<p>No general figures are available which would
indicate the degree of certainty attaching to
the payment of interest upon real-estate mortgages.
Certain classes of mortgages, such as
those secured by unimproved real estate or
dwellings, afford no direct security of interest
payment other than the threat of foreclosure.
Other classes, such as mortgages upon stores,
hotels, or office-buildings, are often protected
by a large income from the direct operation of
the mortgaged premises, thus furnishing a
security for the annual interest payment. The
margin of protection in these cases varies
greatly, so that no general conclusion can be
drawn.</p>

<p>The other characteristics of real-estate mortgages
may be passed over more briefly. It is
generally conceded that mortgages return a
higher rate of income than can be obtained
upon any other form of investment which
affords equal security. This constitutes their
chief advantage.</p>

<p>Their chief disadvantage, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
lies in their entire want of convertibility. There
is no market for real-estate mortgages, and
except in special instances they can not be
readily sold. The fact that they are not subject
to quotation prevents them also from holding
out any prospect of appreciation in value.
Their very deficiency in this respect, however,
constitutes an important advantage from another
point of view. Since they are not quoted
they can not shrink in market price in obedience
to changes in financial and business conditions.
The buyer of a mortgage is assured that he can
carry his mortgage at par through periods
when it may be necessary to mark down all
negotiable securities subject to changing market
quotations. This is frequently a matter of
great importance.</p>

<p>The general characteristics of real-estate
mortgages may be summarized as follows: (1)
When carefully selected and purchased under
favorable conditions, great safety of principal
and interest; (2) a relatively high return; (3)
a low degree of convertibility; (4) no prospect
of appreciation in value; and (5) the practical
certainty of maintaining the integrity of the
principal invested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Is a security possessing these characteristics
a suitable investment for a business surplus?
Only to a limited extent. The safety, high return,
and assurance against loss in quoted value
of principal are all highly desirable qualities
for this purpose, but the lack of convertibility
is a fatal defect. No consideration is of greater
importance in the investment of a business surplus
than a high degree of convertibility, so
that if the need should arise the investment
may be instantly liquidated. The fact that real-estate
mortgages can not be readily disposed
of makes it practically impossible to employ
them for the investment of a business surplus.</p>

<p>Where convertibility is not an essential requirement,
and where the want of promise of
appreciation in value is not a serious matter,
mortgages afford a very desirable form of investment.
The characteristics which they possess
in an eminent degree&mdash;safety, high return,
and assurance against loss in quoted value of
principal&mdash;are exactly suited to the ordinary
requirements of savings-banks. Generally
speaking, only a small proportion of a savings-bank's
assets need be kept in liquid form or
readily convertible, and accordingly they find
mortgages highly desirable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>For the purpose of private investment the
attractiveness of mortgages is not so easy to
determine. Ordinarily, fluctations in quoted
values are of no great importance to the private
investor, so that the absence of quotation
which mortgages enjoy is not especially valuable.
Their safety and high return are attractive
qualities, but their want of convertibility
and of prospect of appreciation in value are
drawbacks. On the whole, the private investor
may probably employ with advantage a certain
part, but not too much of his estate in mortgage
investments.</p>

<p>As part of a scientific and comprehensive
scheme of investment, the special advantages of
real-estate mortgages appear most prominently
in the years following a business depression.
During such a period real-estate
values are usually relatively low, but beginning
to advance, so that mortgages present their
maximum margin of security. At such a time
they compare most favorably with bonds and
other investment securities which are subject to
changing quotations, because such securities
are then apt to be at their highest point under
the combined influence of restored confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and the low money rates which usually prevail.
After several years of continued and increasing
business prosperity the positions are just
reversed.</p>

<p>No discussion of real-estate mortgages
would be complete without allusion to the guaranteed
mortgages which have been placed upon
the market in great quantities within the past
few years. Guaranteed mortgages are real-estate
mortgages guaranteed as to principal
and interest by substantial companies having
large capital and surplus. In addition to the
guaranty, the companies usually search and
guarantee the title, see to it that the taxes,
assessments, and insurance are paid, and perform
the other services of a real-estate broker.
Their compensation varies somewhat, but probably
averages &frac12; per cent&mdash;that is, for example,
they loan at 5 per cent and sell guaranteed
mortgages to the investor at 4&frac12;.</p>

<p>The value of the guaranty may be considered
from two points of view&mdash;first, in the event of
a general decline in real-estate values, and,
secondly, when a fall occurs in a particular
piece of property or in a particular locality.</p>

<p>If a severe decline in real-estate values takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
place, affecting all localities, it might become
necessary for the holders of guaranteed mortgages
to test the value of their guaranties. In
such a case the question would arise how far
the capital and surplus of the guaranteeing
companies would extend in liquidating the
mortgages which they had guaranteed. This
would depend entirely upon the proportion between
the capital and surplus of the companies
and the total amount of outstanding mortgages
guaranteed. Ordinarily the capital and surplus
do not exceed 5 per cent of the mortgages, so
that the average guaranty is good for about 5
per cent additional equity. On a piece of property
worth $100,000, upon which a guaranteed
mortgage of $60,000 exists, the guaranty would
be worth $3,000, and would margin the property
down to $57,000. This additional equity
is of little value. It is probably unlikely that a
40-per-cent depreciation in value will take
place, but the guaranty is not needed unless it
does, and if it should occur, the depreciation is
quite as likely to go to 50 per cent or more as
to stop at 43.</p>

<p>From the second point of view the value of
the guaranty is much greater. The distribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of risk, as in the case of fire-insurance, protects
the holder against loss in the event of a
fall in the particular piece of property upon
which he holds a mortgage, or even in a particular
locality. It can not be said, however, that
the records are yet sufficiently complete to form
a conclusion as to what is a safe proportion
between capital and surplus and outstanding
mortgages. Further than that the guaranteeing
companies, generally speaking, have been
operating since their inception upon a rising
market, so that their success hitherto has not
been remarkable. Allowing for these drawbacks,
however, the private investor, unless so
situated as to give personal attention to the
details of his investments, will probably do well
to purchase his mortgages in guaranteed form.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<h3>INDUSTRIAL BONDS</h3>


<p>Industrial bonds include the obligations
of all manufacturing and mercantile companies,
and miscellaneous companies of a private
character. They form a class quite distinct
from railroad bonds or public-utility bonds.</p>

<p>I. <i>Safety of Principal and Interest.</i> The
safety of industrial bonds, in common with the
safety of all forms of investment, depends upon
the margin of security in excess of the amount
of the obligation. In the case of industrial bonds
the amount of this margin is not always easy to
determine. Even when determined, the rule is
difficult of application because a margin which
may seem insufficient from the point of view of
physical valuation may be satisfactory when
considered as the equity of a working concern.
The indications most to be relied upon in estimating
the safety of industrial bonds are as
follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Value of real estate.</i> The first point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to be determined in considering the purchase of
an industrial bond is the value of the real estate
upon which it is a first mortgage. If the appraised
value of the ground, irrespective of the
buildings and machinery upon it, is greater by
a substantial sum than the amount of the bond
issue, the obligation is practically a real-estate
mortgage. In such a case, while possibly
"slow," <i>i.e.</i>, secured by an assets difficult to realize
upon&mdash;the safety of the bond can hardly
be questioned. In judging a bond upon its real-estate
value, it is not always safe to take the
cost price of the land as shown by the company's
books, because frequently the cost upon
the books is artificially raised by payment having
been made in securities whose market value
is less than par, or in other ways. As stated
above, judgment should be based upon the
<i>appraised</i> value of the land.</p>

<p>If the bond meets this test satisfactorily, the
prospective investor may feel reasonably sure
that the safety of his principal is not in question,
and may buy the bond without anxiety
if it satisfies his other requirements. On the
other hand, if the bond only partially meets this
test, and it appears that some part of its value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
comes from plant and equipment and from the
strength of the company as a working concern,
then it is necessary for the investor to consider
carefully several other factors.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Net quick assets.</i> The balance-sheet of
every industrial company can be divided horizontally
into two parts. Its assets are of two
kinds&mdash;property assets, which are fixt, and current
assets, which are fluid. Similarly, its liabilities
are of two kinds&mdash;capital liabilities and
current liabilities. It requires no very extended
business experience to pick out the items which
make up these totals. Plant and property assets
are usually lumped together under the head,
"Cost of Property." Current assets include inventories,
bills and accounts receivable, agents'
balances, marketable securities, and cash on
hand and in banks&mdash;everything, in short, which
can be quickly converted into cash. On the
other side of the balance-sheet, capital liabilities
are easily determined. They consist of the par
amounts of bonds and stocks outstanding. Current
liabilities comprise bills and accounts payable,
including borrowed money, pay-rolls, and
interest and taxes accrued but not due.</p>

<p>The real strength of every industrial concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
is to be learned from the figures relating
to its current accounts. Property assets and
capital liabilities are not of the same significance.
If the cost of plant and equipment as
shown by the books exceeds its real value, the
market usually makes the necessary adjustment
by putting a price less than par upon the bonds
and stocks.</p>

<p>No such process is possible in the case of the
current accounts. If the current liabilities exceed
the current assets the company shows a
deficit, whatever its surplus may show on the
books. On the other hand, if the current assets
are greater than the current liabilities, the company
possesses a working capital, represented
by the difference between the two, and known
as net quick assets.</p>

<p>There are three things to consider in connection
with net quick assets: First, the proportion
between current assets and current liabilities.
To put a company in good shape its
current assets should be at least twice as great
as its current liabilities. Two for one is a fair
proportion, tho some companies show as much
as six to one. The stronger a company is in
this proportion the better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, the proportion between net quick
assets and bonded debt. The bonded debt
should never exceed net quick assets, except
when the company possesses real estate, in
which case two-thirds of the real-estate value
plus the net quick assets should cover the bonds.
Some companies do much better than that. One
prominent company in this country, altho it possesses
real estate of considerable value, has
agreed in the indenture securing its bonds to
keep net quick assets at all times greater by a
substantial margin than the amount of bonds
outstanding.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the proportion between net quick
assets and the surplus as shown in the balance-sheet.
If the capital liabilities exactly balance
the property assets, it is plain that the surplus
will exactly balance the net quick assets. If
the surplus is smaller than net quick assets, it
is usually a sign that capital liabilities have
been created to provide working capital. Opinions
differ as to the wisdom of this course.
Generally speaking, it is better to provide working
capital by means of a stock issue than to
depend upon the banks for accommodation.
The exception to this rule occurs in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of companies that require a great deal of working
capital for part of the year and only a little
at other times. If they have the best banking
connections, such companies may be safe in depending
upon their banks to carry them, but if
they do so, they should have no bonded or other
fixt indebtedness which would prevent their
paper from being a first lien upon their entire
assets.</p>

<p>If working capital is to be created by the
issue of capital liabilities, it is much better that
it should be done by stocks than by bonds. The
ideal method, however, is to provide only such
an amount of working capital at the organization
of a company as is necessary for the conduct
of its business, and then, as the volume
of its business grows, to accumulate the additional
amount necessary out of earnings,
refraining from the payment of dividends until
the fund is complete.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of net quick assets,
it is well to note the importance of the figure
showing the actual amount of current liabilities.
If a company has outstanding large amounts of
bills and notes payable, it occupies a vulnerable
position. Inability to renew maturing notes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
was the cause of most of the industrial failures
of last year.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Net Earnings.</i> The amount of net earnings
is of great importance in estimating the
strength of an industrial company. The figures
for a number of years should be examined to
determine whether the earnings are increasing
or decreasing, and to discover whether or not
the earning power of the company is stable.
This will depend largely upon the nature of the
article which the company produces or trades
in. If its product enjoys a steady demand at
a fairly uniform price, it is justifiable that some
of its capital should be in the form of bonds;
but if its earnings are subject to violent fluctuations
due to rapid changes in the price of its
product, there is little justification for conducting
the business on borrowed money.</p>

<p>In this connection it should always be considered
how greatly a falling off in gross earnings
will affect net earnings; and the proportion
between net earnings and fixt charges
should be carefully noted.</p>

<p>In order for an industrial bond to receive
favorable consideration, the average yearly net
earnings of the company should amount to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
about three times the annual bond interest,
taxes, and sinking funds. The greater the protection
is in this respect the better.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Form of Issue.</i> The form in which an
industrial bond is issued is a matter of some importance.
If the principal of the bond does not
become due for a number of years, there is
danger that the property will depreciate so far
in value as to leave the bond without sufficient
margin of protection. There are two ways to
overcome this difficulty. One way is to establish
a sinking-fund which will retire a certain
proportion of the bonds by lot each year. Another
way is to issue the bonds in serial form,
with a definite instalment maturing every year.
In either case the annual sinking-fund or annual
instalment should be greater than the
probable depreciation so that the margin of security
will be constantly increasing.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Management and Control.</i> No question
is of greater importance in estimating the
strength of an industrial company than the reputation
of the men in charge. The ability
and integrity of the men who control the
policy of the company and the efficiency of
the operating officials are the principal factors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
in the success of an industrial undertaking.
Vacillating policies, weakly executed, will ruin
the most promising enterprise. This is particularly
true in the case of small companies. Every
man of business experience will understand the
importance of this factor and be guided by it in
the selection of industrial securities.</p>

<p>Based upon the foregoing considerations it
is of interest to inquire what degree of safety
really attaches to the average industrial bond?
How far does it meet the foregoing requirements?
The question is difficult to answer. Industrial
bonds vary greatly in point of safety,
some issues possessing great strength and others
being highly speculative. No general conclusions
can be depended upon, and the investor
is forced to consider each issue upon its own
merits.</p>

<p>II. <i>Rate of Income.</i> The average net return
upon industrial bonds is probably higher than
upon any other form of funded corporate obligation.
This constitutes one of the chief advantages
of industrial bonds.</p>

<p>III. <i>Convertibility.</i> It is impossible to make
any general statement in regard to the convertibility
of industrial bonds. Some industrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
bonds, notably the larger issues of well-known
trusts, command a broad and active market.
Such bonds can be sold in large amounts at
almost any time without seriously affecting the
price. On the other hand, small underlying
issues of such companies, usually high-grade in
point of security, or the obligations of smaller
companies, are almost as unmarketable as real-estate
mortgages. Between these two extremes
all varieties of industrial bonds are to be found.
The degree of convertibility which a security
possesses is usually a matter of some importance,
and the investor should make a careful examination
of each bond in this respect.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Prospect of Appreciation in Value.</i> To
what extent a bond may improve in security
during the time that an investor holds it is of
little importance unless the improvement be reflected
in the market price of the bond. Only
so can the investor take advantage of its appreciation
in value. In order for the improvement
in security to be reflected in market price and
thus add to the principal invested, it is necessary
that a bond should possess a fairly active
market. For this reason the industrial bonds
which hold out the greatest promise of appreciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in value are the larger, more speculative
issues, which possess the greatest convertibility.
The purchase of such bonds frequently
results in substantial profits.</p>

<p>V. <i>Stability of Market Price.</i> The four
points above touched upon&mdash;safety, rate of income,
convertibility, and likelihood of improvement
in intrinsic value&mdash;are all inherent characteristics
of every bond. The likelihood of
favorable or unfavorable fluctation in market
price is largely external in its nature and depends
upon general financial and business
conditions.</p>

<p>As a class, industrial bonds can not be said
to possess much stability of market price.
Some of the smaller issues enjoy a fictitious
stability because of their inactivity, but generally
speaking industrial bonds are subject to
wide fluctations in accordance with changes in
the business outlook.</p>

<p>The foregoing is a summary, necessarily
brief and imperfect, of the main points to be
considered in judging the value of industrial
bonds. The question remains whether such
securities are desirable for the investment of a
business surplus and of private funds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Except in special cases industrial bonds are
not suitable for a business surplus. It is impossible
to find an industrial bond which combines
all the characteristics necessary for that
purpose. The requirements are great safety
of principal and interest, a relatively high return,
ready convertibility, and stability of market
price. Many industrial bonds can be found
which combine two of these requirements,
some even which combine three, but the full
combination, if it exists at all, is unknown to
the writer.</p>

<p>In addition, the principle of distribution of
risk should prevent one industrial company
from investing its reserve funds in the securities
of another industrial company.</p>

<p>For private investment the case is somewhat
different. A man of good business judgment,
who desires to obtain a high yield for which
he is prepared to sacrifice something in the
way of convertibility and prospect of appreciation
in value, may buy the underlying issues of
strong companies with every confidence in the
safety of his principal. Again, the investor
who wants a high yield and quick convertibility,
who is prepared to take a business man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
risk and to sacrifice stability of market price,
may make a large profit by buying second-grade
industrial bonds. No investor, however,
should deceive himself with the idea that any
industrial bond will satisfy all the requirements
of the ideal investment.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<h3>PUBLIC-UTILITY BONDS</h3>


<p>It was a common saying among bond-dealers
a few years ago that the day of the
municipal bond had passed, the day of the railroad
bond was passing, and the day of the
public-utility bond was to be. Municipal bonds
were selling at fancy prices in consequence of
the low rates for money which then prevailed,
and railroad bonds appeared to be following in
their wake. Public-utility bonds alone afforded
a satisfactory yield, and it was felt that the
investing public would be forced to turn to
them.</p>

<p>This prediction, like many others which
were based upon the assumption of continued
ease in money, was destined to be unfulfilled.
Almost immediately there appeared an added
demand for capital, and in the face of this
demand, supplies of capital which had before
seemed ample became suddenly scarce. Money
rates rose rapidly and as a necessary consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
municipal and railroad bonds fell in
price to a point where their net return was
commensurate with that obtained from the
loaning of free capital. The investment situation
was thus completely reversed. It was no
longer a question as to what form of security
investors must seek in order to obtain a satisfactory
yield, but rather could the highest
grade of municipal and railroad bonds be
floated at any price. Under these circumstances
the contemplated necessity of turning
to public-utility bonds never arose, and the general
investing public remains for the most part
unfamiliar with their elements of strength and
of weakness.</p>

<p>The term "public-utility company" denotes a
private corporation supplying public needs under
authority of a public franchise. The franchise
may be of definite date or perpetual, and
may be partial or exclusive.</p>

<p>Public-utility companies include street-railway,
gas, electric-light and power, and water
companies. Properly speaking, telephone companies
should also be included, but they are not
usually regarded as belonging to the class of
public-service corporations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>It is impossible, within the limits of a single
chapter, to discuss each kind of company separately.
The investment value of street-railway
bonds will be here considered, and it is felt
that the general principles advanced, with slight
modifications of detail, will be found equally
applicable to a judgment of other forms of public-service
securities.</p>

<p>I. <i>Safety of Principal and Interest.</i> In
order to determine the safety of a street-railway
company's bonds, the company must be
subjected to a threefold examination, physical,
financial, and political.</p>

<p>An examination must be made into the
extent and condition of the physical property
in order to ascertain whether the bonded debt
is secured by property having a real market
value in excess of the face amount of bonds
issued. The first point to be determined is the
extent and valuation of the company's real
estate. If the appraised value of the land upon
which power-houses and car-barns have been
erected is alone greater than the amount of
bonds outstanding, the investigation need go
no further, for the bonds, in such a case, would
be practically a real-estate mortgage. In most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
instances, however, this is very far from being
the case; and after careful appraisal of the real
estate it is then necessary to make a careful
valuation of the other physical property;
namely, power-plants, depots, car-sheds, roadway,
and equipment.</p>

<p>It is usually impossible for the average investor
to make such an examination himself,
nor is it likely that he would possess sufficient
technical knowledge to render his investigation
of much value. For an accurate estimate of
the value of a street-railway's physical property,
it is usually necessary to depend upon the
expert opinion of a trained engineer. It is a
matter of regret that the average street-railway
report can not be relied upon to furnish an
accurate valuation of the physical property;
and it is accordingly customary for careful
bond-dealers, when they contemplate taking an
issue of street-railway bonds for distribution
among their clients, to have the property examined
by a competent engineer, whose report
then determines for them the question of taking
the issue.</p>

<p>Disregarding the figures which show the
cost of property and equipment upon the company's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
books, the engineer proceeds to make a
careful estimate of the replacement value of
the property, including real estate. If the result
of the examination shows that the property
could not be duplicated for the amount of
the bond issue, the company occupies an unusually
strong position&mdash;altho even in such a case
some part of the value of the bonds comes from
the strength of the company as a going concern.</p>

<p>In most cases, however, it is probably found
that the bond issue is in excess of the value
of real estate and the replacement value of the
physical property, the balance representing a
capitalization of the franchise.</p>

<p>To determine the real value of the franchise
or franchises is a difficult matter and involves
the whole question of the company's relations
with the community which it serves and with
the local lawmaking bodies.</p>

<p>The first question which arises is whether
the franchise is perpetual or for a definite time,
and the second whether it is partial or exclusive.
Franchises vary greatly in these respects.
Sometimes a franchise, apparently partial, is
practically exclusive, owing to the fact that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the available space in the streets is already
occupied by the company's own tracks. If the
franchises of a company are limited as to time,
it is expedient, if not imperative, that the bonds
should mature before the expiration of the
franchises.</p>

<p>If the company whose bonds are under examination
satisfactorily passes this physical
test&mdash;if it possesses real estate of considerable
value, if the replacement value of the property
is as great or nearly as great as the amount of
the bonds, and if the franchises, while perhaps
not perpetual or exclusive, are yet of longer
duration than the bonds and render successful
competition unlikely&mdash;the next step may then
be taken; that is to say, an examination of the
company's financial condition and earning
capacity may be made.</p>

<p>The amount of its gross earnings should be
examined and the figures scrutinized for a
number of years back to discover whether its
earnings are increasing or decreasing. The
position in which the company stands for obtaining
new traffic must be noted, and some
estimate must be made of the stability of its
earning power. In this connection the relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of the company to the public are of great
importance. It must be learned whether the
company follows the policy of conciliating or
ignoring public sentiment.</p>

<p>The net earnings of the company must then
be examined. This involves a criticism of
operating expenses. The payments of the road
must be analyzed to determine whether the
proper amounts have been expended for renewal
of track, replenishment of rolling stock,
and other improvement sufficient to keep the
property in good physical condition. This is
the most intricate subject in the investigation
of a street-railway property. Unless proper
allowance be made for depreciation, in addition
to the expenses of direct operation, it is only
a question of time before the strongest company
will become bankrupt.</p>

<p>Deterioration of plant and equipment, which
goes on constantly, can only be offset in two
ways: one is out of earnings and the other
is out of the security-holders&mdash;that is, by decreases
in the market value of the securities.
The first takes prosperity or courage; the second
leads to bankruptcy. It is difficult to measure
depreciation accurately, but a safe rule is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to write off ten per cent of gross earnings each
month for depreciation. In this way the charge
for depreciation will be proportionate to the
traffic, which provides automatic adjustment.</p>

<p>If the net earnings, after making this allowance
for depreciation, and after providing all
expenses of operation including ordinary repairs,
amount to as much as twice the interest
charges upon the bonds outstanding, it is probable
that the bonds may be taken with safety.</p>

<p>Before finally determining the question, however,
certain political factors must be taken
into consideration. The relations of the company
to the leaders of the dominant political
party must be investigated. The likelihood of
agitation looking toward a reduction of fares
must be considered and the possibility of increase
in taxes (if below the legal limit) must
be weighed. The probable attitude of the legislature
on the question of renewing the franchises
when they expire must be considered. In
general, it must be learned whether any real
ground of contention exists between the company
on the one hand and the public and its
representatives on the other, because it is inevitable
that the company will weaken its independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of position by too close a connection
with politics, and that the physical property
will suffer if there is any lack of uninterrupted
attention to it.</p>

<p>Finally one other thing should be investigated&mdash;the
amount of the accident account and its
proportion to the net earnings of the company.
On small lines a single case of heavy damages
will sometimes make serious inroads upon the
earnings.</p>

<p>The foregoing is a summary, necessarily
brief and imperfect, but true in its essential outlines,
of the main points which should be considered
in judging the safety of street-railway
bonds. The question remains, how far does the
average street-railway company satisfy these
requirements? Broadly speaking, street-railway
bonds are not yet to be classed in the first
rank of investment securities. The troubles
which have come to a head in the financial
operations of the traction systems in New York
and Chicago are typical of troubles which are
likely to occur elsewhere from the same general
causes&mdash;overcapitalization in the first place
and insufficient allowance for depreciation in
the second place. In both New York and Chicago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the crisis was hastened by open and obvious
overcapitalization, which is almost inevitable
when many independent lines are merged
into one system. The same trouble, however,
is apt to occur in other traction systems where
this evil appeared less flagrant at the outset.</p>

<p>The advantages of electricity over horsepower
naturally led to the multiplication of
electric street lines, as the system ten or fifteen
years ago passed beyond the experimental stage.
As in all new enterprises, speculation ran ahead
of the reality and financing built upon oversanguine
calculations has too often had difficulty
in squaring accounts when brought face to
face with facts. In most of the calculations insufficient
allowance was made for the wear and
tear of service; in other words, for renewal
of road and equipment. After a few years'
test of earnings against expenses, it became
evident that a proper allowance for depreciation
of plant would show a heavy deficit in the
income account. In most cases therefore no
allowance or only a meager one was made.
For a time this method of bookkeeping proved
less disastrous than might have been expected
owing to the rapid growth of population and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
business in American cities. It was possible in
many cases to consider the enhanced value
given to the franchise by growth of business
as an offset to the depreciation of tracks and
equipment. In so far also as the plant was
kept up to a high degree of efficiency by charging
the expense of repairs to operating expenses,
the absence of a depreciation account
was partially offset.</p>

<p>With the progress of recent years, however,
a new factor has been entering into the problem
which promises to make the situation still
more serious for the traction systems. This
new factor is the rise in prices and wages.
Temporarily the influence of this factor may
be checked by diminished business activity, but
when normal conditions are restored, it will
commence to act again upon the railways with
accumulated effect.</p>

<p>In most cases a proposition to increase the
standard street-railway fare above five cents
as an offset to the increased operating expenses
would be so revolutionary a proposal that it
could hardly be carried through. With the
line of cost converging upon the line of receipts
and with no proper allowance made for depreciation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the traction systems of the country
seem to be facing a difficult problem. In the
long run it can not be doubted that the problem
will be met and solved in a way to afford justice
alike to the public who use the cars and to the
capitalists who have made street traction on a
large scale possible, but in the meantime the
investor who desires perfect safety should exercise
great care and discrimination in his purchases
of street-railway obligations.</p>

<p>II. <i>Rate of Income.</i> As a general rule,
street-railway bonds in common with the obligations
of all public-service corporations sell
upon about the same income basis as high-grade
industrial bonds&mdash;that is to say, under
normal conditions they return considerably
more than railroad or municipal bonds.</p>

<p>III. <i>Convertibility.</i> It is difficult to speak
of the convertibility of public-utility bonds as a
class for the reason that they differ widely
from one another in this respect. In general, it
is certainly more difficult to dispose of public-utility
bonds than railroad bonds. They do not
possess sufficient convertibility to justify their
purchase by any one who may need to realize
quickly on his holdings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>IV. <i>Prospect of Appreciation in Value.</i>
Public-utility bonds, except such issues as are
convertible into stock, possess little prospect of
appreciation in value. It was pointed out
above that depreciation is not properly allowed
for, and it is very difficult for the securities to
advance in the face of this obstacle.</p>

<p>V. <i>Stability of Market Price.</i> The bonds
of public-service corporations are relatively
more stable than railroad bonds because their
earnings are not subject to the fluctations
which occur in railroad properties between
years of prosperity and years of depression. At
the same time, it should be pointed out that
their stability of price is largely fictitious, owing
to the comparative inactivity of the issues.
In other words, while the quotation may be
maintained, it is usually difficult to sell any
large quantity of a public-service corporation's
bonds in a period of financial disturbance, while
railroad bonds are more easily liquidated even
if at a sacrifice.</p>

<p>The question remains, do public-utility bonds
afford a desirable security for the investment
of a business surplus and of private funds? In
regard to the former, it may be said at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that public-utility bonds do not meet the necessary
conditions. The security is too doubtful,
the convertibility is too small, and the stability
of price too uncertain.</p>

<p>For private investment the case is somewhat
different. Keeping in mind the desirability of
diversifying investments and admitting the
attractiveness of investing in a class of property
whose earnings are comparatively stable,
it seems clear that public-utility bonds can not
be dismissed without consideration. When a
company is found whose property is substantially
equal in real value to its bonded debt,
whose allowance for depreciation is ample,
whose franchises are satisfactory, whose earning
capacity is large, and whose management
is capable and upright, the investor is justified
in giving careful consideration to its issues.
Unless all these points are found to be satisfactory,
however, the investor should content
himself with some other form of security. For
some years to come it is to be feared that many
of our public-service corporations will suffer
from the war of discordant elements&mdash;disregard
of the rights of the public on the part of
the management and socialistic agitation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
control on the part of the community. Until
these warring factions are reconciled and the
questions at issue adjusted with fairness to the
security-holders and the public, the investor
should be most prudent in his purchases of public-utility
obligations.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<h3>MUNICIPAL BONDS</h3>


<p>The previous chapters have considered, in
turn, the investment value of railroad
bonds, real-estate mortgages, industrial bonds,
and public-utility bonds. The desirability of
each of these different classes of security has
been judged in accordance with the general
principles laid down in the introductory chapter;
that is to say, each class has been analyzed
in relation to safety, rate of income, convertibility,
prospect of appreciation in value and
stability of market price. The same determining
factors must now be applied to a judgment
of government, State, and municipal bonds.</p>

<p>Bonds issued by a national government, by
a State, or by a municipality are based primarily
on some form of the power of taxation, tho
the bonds are usually tax exempt within the
political unit which creates them.</p>

<p>When the power of taxation is unlimited, as
in the case of the national government and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
sovereign States, there can be no question as
to the ability of the political unit to meet its
obligation, and the question becomes entirely
one of good faith. It is probable that the obligations
of the United States Government, by
reason of the fact that the per-capita debt of
the country is so small, the wealth of the country
so great, and the good faith of the American
people so clearly established, represent the
highest type of security to be found in the
world. It is quite possible, therefore, that the
2-per-cent United States Consols would sell in
any case at a relatively higher price than the
obligations of any other country, but it can not
be denied that the chief reason which causes
them to sell at the remarkably high price which
they have attained is the fact that they are
required by national banks as security for circulation.
This fact is doubtless the controlling
element in their market position, and at once
accounts for their special strength and removes
them from the field of private investment.</p>

<p>Only less secure than United States bonds
are the obligations of the sovereign States of
the Union. State bonds usually sell upon a
basis which may be taken as the equivalent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
pure interest, with no element of risk or speculation
involved. The obligations of different
States sell at different prices, in accordance
with market conditions and the relations of
supply and demand, but there can be no question
of the equal ability of all States to pay
their obligations. Repudiation of State debts
has occurred in our history, but only in cases
where an overwhelming majority of the citizens
were opposed to the creation of the debt at the
time of its issue, but lacked the means to control
the situation. Such instances are chiefly
to be found in the case of the so-called carpet-bag
governments of the Southern States after
the Civil War.</p>

<p>Municipal bonds&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the bonds of cities,
counties, and townships&mdash;are indirectly a first
lien upon all taxable property in the municipality,
and take precedence of every form of
mortgage or judgment lien. This lien is enforced
through a tax levy to meet interest and
principal, and this tax levy the courts will compel
in the rare cases in which a municipality
attempts to repudiate a valid bond. This priority
of the tax lien is the foundation of the
prime position of municipal bonds. The case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
rarely occurs where a bond held valid by the
courts proves uncollectable if sufficient taxing
power existed when the bond was issued to
provide for its redemption. It is only when
the municipality itself diminishes in population
and taxable property to the vanishing-point
that such a default can occur. An investor
can judge for himself as to the likelihood
of such a catastrophe in any particular
community, and can feel sure that his bond, if
valid and protected by a sufficient taxing
power, is as secure in its principal and interest
as the municipality which issues it is secure in
its continued existence. The following are the
chief points which should be considered in the
investigation of a municipal bond: (1) The
proportion which the total debt of the municipality
bears to the assessed valuation of the
property subject to taxation. Usually a maximum
rate is fixt by constitutional provision
which rarely exceeds 10 per cent. (2) The
purpose of issue. This must be a proper and
suitable one. (3) The proceedings under
which the bonds were issued. These proceedings,
the form of bonds, their execution, and
their legal details must be in full compliance
with the law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>If these points are found to be satisfactory,
the investor may rest content that no other
form of security is so greatly safeguarded and
that his bond ranks upon a substantial equality
with government and State obligations.</p>

<p>The rate of income to be derived from investment
in municipal bonds varies in accordance
with the obligations selected. Like other forms
of security, municipal bonds are controlled by
market conditions, and their price is determined
by the relations of supply and demand,
and by adjustment to prevailing money rates.
While differing only moderately from one another
in point of safety and income return,
municipal bonds may be divided into two distinct
classes in accordance with the degree of
convertibility which they possess. Some municipal
bonds possess great convertibility;
others almost none. The feature which chiefly
determines the activity or inactivity of a municipal
issue is the size and importance of the municipality,
together with the amount of bonds
which it has outstanding. The bonds of large
and important cities, whose outstanding debt
reaches considerable proportions, usually possess
great activity. They are constantly traded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in and command a broad market because dealers
are willing to buy or sell them in blocks
at prices within a fraction of 1 per cent apart.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the bonds of counties,
townships, and small cities are usually quite
inactive. Transactions rarely occur in them,
dealers do not make a market in them, and they
can be sold only to genuine investors. It is
often impossible to have them even quoted.</p>

<p>At first sight, it would appear that active
municipal bonds would be much more desirable,
but inactive municipals possess a special advantage
which the active ones do not enjoy.
They possess more stability of market price.
It is true that their stability of value is due to
the fact that they are not traded in or quoted
and is, therefore, largely fictitious, but nevertheless
it accomplished a useful purpose. It
enables the investor to carry inactive municipals
at cost price upon his books through periods
in which active market bonds would require
to be marked down in conformity with
prevailing market prices. No other class of
investment except real-estate mortgages possesses
to the same degree this quality of price
stability. For many classes of buyers&mdash;savings-banks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
for example&mdash;stability of price is
a consideration of prime importance. The
preservation of the savings-bank's surplus and,
indeed, the continued solvency of the institution
depend upon maintaining the integrity of the
principal which it has invested. A savings-bank
requires, also, great safety of principal
and interest; <i>i.e.</i>, the certainty that principal
and interest instalments will be paid at maturity.
It needs only a fair but not high yield,
and it does not need to place emphasis upon
convertibility or prospect of appreciation in
value. Comparison of these requirements with
the characteristics of inactive municipal bonds
discloses a striking adaptability on their part
to the real needs of the case. As a consequence,
it is not surprizing to discover that inactive
municipals are greatly sought by savings-banks.</p>

<p>The desirability of inactive municipals for
savings-bank investment was never more forcibly
illustrated than on the first of last January,
when the savings-banks came to make up their
annual statements. Broadly speaking, there
can be no doubt that they were saved by the
large quantity of inactive municipals and real-estate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
mortgages which they carried. Had any
considerable portion of their assets consisted
of railroad bonds and active municipals, upon
which they should have had to write off a loss
of ten to fifteen points, their solvency would
almost certainly have been impaired.</p>

<p>But we are chiefly concerned in these pages
with the advantages and disadvantages of different
forms of investment from the point of
view of a business man, both for the investment
of his business surplus and of his private
funds. Do municipal bonds, either active or
inactive, conform to the requirements of the
business surplus? It can not be said that they
do. Municipal bonds possess either convertibility
without stability of price or stability of
price without convertibility. Both qualities are
necessary for a business surplus. The only
form of municipal security which is at all
adapted for the investment of a business surplus
is a short-term issue of an active municipal
bond. If it has only a very few years to run,
its constant approach to maturity will invest it
with the necessary stability of price. But even
in this case equal safety and equal stability of
price combined with a higher yield can probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
be found in some high-grade railroad issue&mdash;either
a short-term mortgage or equipment
bond.</p>

<p>For private investment the case is somewhat
different. Enough has been said in the preceding
chapters to impress upon the reader the
importance of buying securities only in accordance
with his real requirements. If any investor,
after careful comparison of the characteristics
of municipal bonds, either active or
inactive, with his necessities, decides that he
can more closely satisfy his requirements with
municipals than with any other form of security,
he should not hesitate to purchase them.
It is the opinion of the writer, however, that
a thorough survey of the field of investment
will generally disclose to the investor some
security in either the railroad or corporation
field which will suit his requirements as well
as the municipal bond and at the same time
provide him with a greater income.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<h2>VIII</h2>

<h3>STOCKS</h3>


<p>Passing to the consideration of stocks as
investments, it is necessary at the outset
that the reader should have clearly in mind the
fundamental difference between stocks and
bonds. This distinction was drawn in the introductory
chapter, but it will be well to
amplify it here, even at the risk of carrying
the reader over familiar ground.</p>

<p>The distinction between bonds and stocks is
that between <i>promises to pay</i> and <i>equities</i>.
Bonds, loans on collateral, and real-estate mortgages
represent some one's promise to pay a
sum of money at a future date; and if the
promise be valid and the security ample, the
holder of the promise will be paid the money
on the date due. Stocks, on the other hand,
represent only a beneficial interest or residuary
share in the assets and profits of a working
concern after payment of its obligations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
fixt charges. The value of the residuary share
may be large or small, may increase or diminish,
but in no case can the holder of such a
share require any one, least of all the company
itself, to take his share off his hands at the
price he paid for it, or, indeed, at any price.
If a man buys a $1,000 railroad bond, he knows
that the railroad, if solvent, will pay him $1,000
in cash when the bond matures, but if he buys
a share of railroad stock his only chance of
getting his money back, if he should wish it,
is that some one else will want to buy his share
from him at the price he paid for it or more.
If he buys a bond he becomes a creditor of the
company, without voice in its management, but
entitled to receive his principal and interest
when due under pain of forfeiture of the security
which the company made over to the trustee
to insure payment. If he buys stock, he becomes
a partner in a business enterprise, exercising
his proportionate share in the direction
of the company's affairs, and sharing ratably
in its profits and losses. In the one case he
buys a promise to pay and in the other an
equity.</p>

<p>This distinction, which appears plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
marked in theory, has been much obscured in
recent years by the influence of two factors.
As the country grew in size, the large corporations&mdash;the
railroads, for example&mdash;required
greater capital in order to provide facilities for
the handling of their growing business. It was
impossible to provide this capital wholly by
means of bond issues without destroying the
proportion between bonds and stocks, which
alone could give to the bondholders the protection
of a substantial equity. It was therefore
necessary to obtain a large part of the capital
required in the form of stock. The railway-managers
were thus confronted with a difficult
problem. It was imperative that they should
obtain more capital, and it was impossible to
dispose of sufficient stock on the basis of a speculative
risk in a business venture. It was therefore
necessary for the railway-managers to
emphasize, as far as possible, the investment
character of their stock, and various expedients
were adopted to accomplish this purpose. In
some cases preferred stocks were created or resulted
from reorganizations, which possest a
first lien upon the assets after payment of the
obligations, and which were entitled to a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
stipulated dividend before the common
stock obtained any distribution from the earnings.
In this way the railway-managers
created a compromise security which could be
regarded as a stock, and would thus provide
equity from the bondholders' point of view,
and, at the same time, one which could be disposed
of to investors. In other cases, which
were probably more numerous, railway-managers
attempted to give their stock an investment
value through stability of income return.
In good years when the company earned 10 or
15 per cent on its stock, their policy was to pay
only 5 or 6 per cent in dividends, and hold the
rest in their surplus fund in order to have the
means of paying the same dividends the next
year if only 2 or 3 per cent should be earned.
By giving their stock stability of income return
they hoped and expected to give it some stability
of market price, and thus make it attractive
to genuine investors. The effect of this policy
was unquestionably successful, and one after
another the stocks of our more important
transportation systems and other large undertakings
passed into the hands of investors.</p>

<p>The successful adoption of this policy on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
part of the railway-managers and other captains
of industry has had one curious effect
which was not contemplated by the originators
of the movement, and which brings us to the
second influence mentioned above as having
tended to obscure the distinction between bonds
and stocks. When a case has been brought before
the courts in which the contention was
advanced that the charges of the railway or
public-service corporation were too high, the
courts appear to have taken the ground that
stocks and bonds should be classed together in
order to determine the aggregate capitalization
of the company, and that the justice or injustice
of the contention that the charges are too
high should be determined by ascertaining
whether if the charges were made lower the net
earnings would still be sufficient to pay a fair
return on the total capital invested. This is the
general line of reasoning pursued by the courts,
both in the case of the Consolidated Gas Company
in New York and the Pennsylvania Railroad
in Pennsylvania. The effect of this attitude
on the part of the courts has been to
obscure still more greatly the real distinction
between bonds and stocks. It is too early as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
yet to judge what will be the final outcome of
the changed attitude toward stocks, but it can
not be doubted that the present tendency of
opinion on the subject, so far as large corporations
are concerned, is to limit the return on
stocks to a strictly investment basis, instead of
leaving the stockholders free to reap all possible
profit from their business venture subject
to the restraints of competition.</p>

<p>The adoption of this attitude by the courts
should be a matter for serious consideration
on the part of present and prospective stockholders.
If the maximum return on stock is
to be limited to 6 per cent, or any fair investment
basis, and charges reduced to consumers
so that they obtain the benefit of any greater
earning power, it would appear that the stockholders
occupy an undesirable position. With
their possible profits limited, but with no fixt
return insured to them and no guaranty
against possible loss, it can not be held that the
purchase of stock seems attractive.</p>

<p>These questions, however, will doubtless be
settled in the long run in justice both to the
public and to the stockholders, and in the meantime
the stocks of our large and successful railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and industrial corporations, which have
attained a certain stability and permanence of
value, are entitled to consideration when investments
are contemplated. It is not worth while
to lay down rules for judging the investment
value of such stocks, because the general principles
advanced in the preceding chapters will be
found sufficient for a judgment of their values.</p>

<p>One class of stocks, however, deserves special
mention. Bank and trust-company stocks
possess one characteristic in higher degree than
other classes of stock. Owing to the general
practise of self-regulated banking institutions
to distribute only about one-half their earnings
in dividends and to credit the rest to surplus
account, a steady rise is assured in the book
value of the stock. No other class of stock possesses
quite the same promise of appreciation
in value. Bank and trust-company stocks are
especially sought by wealthy men, who can
forego something in the way of income return
for the sake of increasing the amount of their
principal. The general characteristics of bank
stocks are great safety, a low rate of income,
limited convertibility, and practical certainty of
appreciation in value.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>With the present chapter the discussion of
specific forms of investments has come to an
end. The next and concluding chapter will explain
the general principles which control the
market movements of all negotiable securities,
and will endeavor to point out the indications
which may be relied upon in determining
whether or not given conditions are favorable
for the purchase of securities.</p>

<h3>MARKET MOVEMENTS OF SECURITIES</h3>


<p>There is no question connected with the
investment of money more important than
the ability to judge whether general market
conditions are favorable for the purchase of
securities.</p>

<p>After learning how to judge the value of
every form of investment, a man may still be
unsuccessful in the investment of money unless
he acquires also a firm grasp upon the general
principles which control the price movements
of securities. By this it is not meant that a
man needs to have an intimate knowledge of
technical market conditions whereby to estimate
temporary fluctations of minor importance,
but rather that he should have clearly in
mind the causes which operate to produce the
larger swings of prices. If an investor acquires
such a knowledge, he is enabled to take advantage
of large price movements in such a
way as materially to increase his income, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
at the same time, avoid carrying upon his books
securities which may have cost much more than
their current market quotations. If he can
recognize the indications which point to the
beginning of a pronounced upward swing in
securities, and if he can equally recognize the
signs which indicate that the movement has
culminated, he can liquidate the securities which
he bought at the inception of the rise or transfer
them to some short-term issues whose near
approach to maturity will render them stable
in price, allowing the downward swing to proceed
without disturbing him. It is not expected,
of course, that the average business man
will be able to realize completely this ideal of
investment, but it is hoped that the following
analysis will give him a clearer conception of
the principles involved.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, the market movements of
all negotiable securities are controlled by two
influences, sometimes acting in opposition to
each other and sometimes in concert. One of
these influences is the loaning rate of free capital;
the other is the general condition of business.
A low rate of interest or the likelihood
of low rates has the effect of stimulating security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
prices, because banks and other money-lending
institutions are forced into the investment
market when they can not loan money to advantage.
Conversely, a high rate of interest
or the prospect of high rates has the effect of
depressing prices, because banking institutions
sell their securities in order to lend the money
so released. The automatic working of this
process tends to produce a constant adjustment
between the yields upon free and invested capital.
When money rates are low, securities tend
to advance to the point where the return upon
them is no greater than that derived from the
loaning of free capital. When rates are high,
securities tend to decline to a point where the
return is as great. This explains the influence
of the first factor.</p>

<p>The other factor is the general condition of
business. Good business conditions, or the
promise of good conditions, tend to advance
security prices, because they indicate larger
earnings and a stronger financial condition.
Poor business conditions, or an unpromising
outlook, have the reverse effect.</p>

<p>The larger movements of security prices are
always the resultant of the interaction of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
two forces. When they work together the
effect is irresistible, as when low interest rates
and the prospect of good business conditions
occur together, or when high money rates
occur in the face of an indicated falling off in
business activity. At such times all classes of
securities swing together. For the most part,
however, money rates and business conditions
are opposed in their influence, rates being low
when business is bad and high when business
is good. Usually the worse business conditions
become, the easier money grows; while the
more active business becomes, the higher
money rates rise. The effect of this antagonism
between the controlling causes is to produce
movements of different proportions and sometimes
in different directions in different classes
of securities. High-grade bonds may be declining,
middle-grade bonds remaining stationary,
and poor bonds advancing, all at the same time.
This serves to give a very irregular appearance
to the security markets, and appears to justify
the widely held opinion that security prices are
a pure matter of guesswork, and that they are
controlled only by manipulation and special influences.
A clear conception of the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the influences which are always silently at work
reconciles these apparent inconsistencies and
makes it plain that general price movements
are determined by laws as certain in their
operation as the laws of nature.</p>

<p>This may be illustrated by a single example.
Let us assume that interest rates are low and
business conditions bad with prospect of still
lower interest rates and still more unpromising
business conditions. What will be the effect
upon different classes of securities? High-grade
bonds, such as choice municipals, whose
safety can not be impaired by any extent of depression
in business, will advance because their
market price is influenced almost wholly by
money rates. If their interest is certain to be
paid, no matter what business conditions may
become, they can not be greatly affected by a
reduction of earnings, and consequently the influence
of low money rates is left to act practically
alone. Middle-grade bonds, such as second-class
railroad issues, will remain almost
stationary, low money rates tending to advance
their price and the fear of decreased earnings
tending to depress them. The lowest grade of
bonds and stocks, whose margin of security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
even in good times is not very great, will probably
suffer in price because the fear of default
in interest and of reduction in dividends will
operate much more strongly than the mere
stimulus of low interest rates. Of course,
securities can not be clearly separated into these
three classes, but shade imperceptibly into one
another. The classification is adopted only for
purposes of illustration.</p>

<p>Up to this point we have been concerned
merely in showing that the market movements
of negotiable securities are controlled by the influence
of certain factors. A more important
question now remains to be considered, viz.:
whether the effect of these two influences is to
produce general swings in prices which may be
depended upon with comparative certainty, and,
if so, what indications are afforded to the investor
of the commencement or culmination of
such a movement. The answer must be that
the combined effect of the two influences described
is to produce definite and regular
swings in prices, and that the indications which
define the movements are not difficult to follow.</p>

<p>A general survey of the history of every
industrial nation reveals the fact that business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
conditions undergo alternate periods of prosperity
and depression extending in clearly defined
cycles of substantially uniform length. By
tracing the usual course of interest rates and
of business conditions throughout one of these
cycles, a general idea can be formed of the way
in which the joint influences operate to produce
price movements. To what extent the course
of interest rates is a cause as well as a result
of changing business conditions, we shall not
attempt here to estimate, but will be content to
note carefully the general course which rates
for money pursue throughout the cycles. Immediately
after a financial crisis, which usually
closes an era of great business prosperity,
money rates become abnormally easy. Within
a few months from the climax of the crisis,
money accumulates in enormous volume in
financial centers. This is caused by the great
diminution of business activity which renders
unnecessary a large part of the circulating
medium that was formerly required to transact
the greater volume of business. To the extent
to which this accumulation of money merely reflects
a redundancy of currency as distinguished
from real liquid capital, it can have little effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in encouraging the resumption of business
activity. As time passes, however, and economies
in operation commence to make themselves
manifest, and especially as waste and extravagance
are curtailed, the country as a whole
commences to accumulate real liquid capital;
that is to say, its total production leaves a surplus
over the amount of consumption. In the
state of business feeling which has been pictured,
the undertaking of new business ventures
or additions to existing properties would
not be approved, so that the surplus wealth
created finds its way into bank deposits as
liquid capital. The competitive attempt to loan
this capital at a time when borrowers are few
produces merely nominal interest rates. This
continues for some time. It is only gradually
as confidence returns and as the spirit of initiative
begins to reassert itself that some part of
the liquid capital created each year is diverted
into fixt forms. Here and there some enterprising
group of men will develop a mine, lay
a new piece of railway, or make some addition
to an existing undertaking. For some length
of time, however, the liquid capital of the country
not only remains unimpaired, but is continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
increasing. After a time a change comes.
The annual surplus of production, tho larger
than before, is only sufficient to provide for the
new undertakings which the growing optimism
demands. Interest rates rise moderately in response
to the added demand for capital. A few
years further along, as business activity increases
and success appears plainly to wait upon
new ventures, the demand for new capital with
which to develop increased facilities and new
enterprises exceeds the annual supply of wealth
created. Prosperity having increased, another
factor commences to assert itself. The spirit of
economy and thrift which had prevailed
throughout the years of depression gives place
to extravagance, the demand for luxuries, and
other unproductive forms of expenditure.
While the total production is much greater than
in the lean years, the margin of production is
not proportionately as great, and this amount
is insufficient to meet the demands upon it. The
supplies of liquid capital stored up during the
years of depression are resorted to, and they
serve to provide the new capital for a few additional
years. Interest rates at once reflect the
encroachment upon stored-up capital, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
rise gives the first real warning of the country's
true position. The optimistic business men do
not heed the warning. After exhausting all the
real capital available in the country, they proceed
to borrow extensively from foreigners or
from government banks&mdash;in this country from
the national government through bank deposits.
Every step which can be taken to induce foreigners
to part with their capital is resorted to.
If foreigners will not buy long-term bonds,
short-term notes are created. If the foreigners
refuse these, they are asked to make loans secured
by the new bonds and notes. The rates
of interest offered are so attractive that considerable
sums are usually obtained, and the pressure
of business activity continues further.
Finally the day of reckoning arrives when some
incident, usually unimportant in itself, first suggests
to the lenders of money that their debtors
whom they know to be overextended may not
be able to pay their loans. The attempt to collect
their loans produces a financial crisis which
brings to an end the period of prosperity.</p>

<p>The foregoing is a description of the more
important stages through which business conditions
pass from crisis to crisis. Different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
cycles vary in particular details, but all agree
in essential outlines. Sometimes special influences
are at work which operate to shorten
or prolong the cycle. The approach of a crisis
will be retarded by inflation of the currency,
for the excess finds its way into bank vaults and
increases the volume of loanable credit. The
effect of such inflation, however, is wholly
disastrous, because the addition to the supply of
capital is fictitious, not real, and only defers
the day of reckoning for a greater catastrophe.
On the other hand, the approach of a crisis can
be greatly hastened by wars, conflagrations,
and other agencies which destroy capital, and
by attacks upon capital and the conduct of corporate
business, for such attacks tend to render
capital timid and produce the same effect as a
violent curtailment of the supply. These are
only some of the many influences which might
become operative, but they serve to show the
necessity for careful consideration of all the
factors at work if a true conception of the condition
and tendencies of business is to be
formed.</p>

<p>From the general account given above of the
successive phases of a credit cycle, it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to summarize the course of interest rates and
the course of business conditions. Money rates
become suddenly easy after a crisis, remain low
or grow easier for a period of several years, and
then rise continuously until the next crisis, advancing
with great rapidity toward the close of
the cycle. Business conditions remain poor or
grow worse a few years after a crisis. Liquidation
is taking place, prices are going down,
and the uncertainty of the outlook causes diminished
activity. Thereafter, however, conditions
improve and activity increases with fair
uniformity until it reaches the high tension of
the period immediately preceding the crisis.
The course of interest rates and the course of
business conditions may both be deflected by
the operation of special influences, but the general
tendencies are substantially as outlined.
The result of the operation of these joint factors
may be traced in the market movements
of any class of security desired. For the sake
of simplicity, let us consider their effect in producing
the market swings of the highest grade
of investment issues and of the lowest grade,
those which are affected only by money rates
and those which are affected almost wholly by
business conditions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Emerging from the strain of the crisis at
their lowest point, high-grade bonds, such as
the best municipal and railroad issues, advance
rapidly as interest rates decline, continuing
their advancing tendency throughout the period
of business depression which follows upon the
heels of the crisis. As business conditions improve,
their position, while perfectly secure before,
is further strengthened and an added stimulus
is given to their rise. About the middle
of the cycle when the business outlook is very
promising, and before interest rates have sustained
any material advance, the prices of high-grade
bonds are usually at their highest point.
From that time forward they commence to decline,
in spite of the increasing prosperity of
the country, under the influence of rising money
rates. They make their lowest prices in the
midst of the crisis, when the strain upon capital
is greatest and the outlook for business most
unpromising.</p>

<p>The lowest grade of bonds, on the other hand
(whose margin of security is least), do not
commence to recover materially in price, in
spite of the influence of low money rates during
the hard times which follow the crisis, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
influence of reduced earnings and the fear of
default of interest holding them in check. As
the outlook becomes brighter, they advance rapidly
and continue to improve in price so long
as they yield more than current money rates.
At some point, difficult to determine in advance
but usually well along toward the end of the
cycle, they reach their high point and thereafter
decline under the influence of the growing
stringency in money.</p>

<p>Between these two extremes, every class of
security is to be found. The better ones will
tend to resemble, in their market movements,
the course pursued by the choicest bonds; the
poorer ones will approximate the lowest class.
In every case, however, unless special influences
operate to produce variations, the market swing
of a given security should be easily conjectured
by an investor who gives careful attention to
the relative weight which is likely to attach to
each determining influence.</p>
